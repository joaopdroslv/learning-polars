# My ROADMAP to learn Polars

1. **Data Structures in Polars**

- pl.DataFrame vs pl.Series
- Creating DataFrames in Polars
- Reading and writing files (CSV, Parquet, JSON)

2. **Data Manipulation**

- Selecting and filtering columns (select, filter)
- Expressions in Polars (with_columns, mutate, alias)
- Operations with lazyframes (lazy execution)

3. **Grouping and Aggregation**

- Grouping (groupby, agg)
- Sorting and joins (sort, join)

4. **Optimizations and Performance**

- LazyFrame vs. DataFrame: when to use?
- Parallel execution and automatic optimizations
- Working with large datasets (>1GB)

5. **Advanced Cases**

- Integration with SQL (pl.SQLContext)
- Working with nested JSONs
- Creating custom functions (apply, map)
- Usage in ETL flows and Data Pipelines
