# Learning Polars

Welcome to my Polars repository!

This repository is for `learning` and `practicing` the **Polars** library in Python. The goal is to explore its features and understand how it can be used as an alternative to Pandas for data processing and analysis.

**Purpose**

This repository includes examples and notebooks to:

- Understand the differences between Polars and Pandas
- Explore key features of Polars like filtering, aggregation, and joins
- Compare the performance of Polars and Pandas on large datasets
- Learn how to efficiently handle big datasets with Polars

`⚠️ IMPORTANT`: This repository is still in progress.
